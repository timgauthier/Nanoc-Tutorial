You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

    #!ruby
    def print_hi(name)
      puts "Hi, #{name}"
    end
    print_hi('Tom')
    #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.


Sometimes you have to put things in `HTML` format too:

    #!html
    <div id="home">
      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Content about tim</p>
    </div>

Look at my awesome code:

    #!ruby
    def meow
     puts 'Meow... meow!'
    end
